  I want to rebuild this code that I did from back in cycle.

  build process
    npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server html-webpack-plugin
    created webpack.config.js
    scripts in package.json
    used horse.html as the entrypoin in the webpack.config.js
    had an issue with html-loader, had to install: npm install --save-dev html-loader. and add the html-loader in webpack.config
